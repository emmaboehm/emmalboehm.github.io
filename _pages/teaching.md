## Teaching Experience
I have served as an assistant instructor ("AI" at Indiana University, equivalent to a teach assistant) for a number of courses ranging from non-majors biology to honors level evolution. 
To learn more directly about pedagogy and inclusive teaching, 
I also completed the [Graduate Teaching Apprenticeship Program through the Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning ](https://citl.indiana.edu/programs/ai-support/grad-apprentice-program/gtap-award.html) while at Indiana University.
