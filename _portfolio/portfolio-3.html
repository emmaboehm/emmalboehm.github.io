Often "stress" responses within and between populations are measured between binary extremes (ex. drought vs. well-watered).
However, while extremes are expected to becoming increasingly common in some areas of the globe, natural populations likely 
experience environmental stressors along a gradient. I'm interested in evaluating potential changes in traits, plasticity, and maternal effects 
under finer-scale stress gradients to better understand the thresholds and nuances of plant population response and evolutionary 
trajectories to stressful and novel enviornments.
