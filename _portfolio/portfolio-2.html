excerpt: "Theoretical studies suggest the evolution of plasticity largely depends on the presence of environmental heterogeneity and the nature of this heterogeneity may select for different types of potentially adaptive plasticity: 
within-generation (i.e., plasticity occurs within one generation) or transgenerational (i.e., plasticity occurs across generations). While there has been extensive theory regarding conditions that favor the evolution of adaptive plasticity, 
we still lack large-scale empirical tests of theoretical predictions, particularly for the expected evolution of within-generation and transgenerational plasticity in heterogeneous environments.
