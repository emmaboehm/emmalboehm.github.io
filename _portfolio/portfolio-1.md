title: "<img src='/images/collinsia_for_website.jpg' align='right' width='300' height='300'>How does environmental distance influence local adaptation and the strength of selection?"
excerpt: "Populations may exhibit local adaptation due to a suite of abiotic and biotic selection pressures. Local adaptation can be assessed with reciprocal transplant experiments or by provenance trials where many source populations are planted into multiple common gardens across broad environmental gradients. Climate change may disrupt patterns of local adaptation. If so, then populations might not necessarily have highest fitness in environments closely matching the current environmental conditions of their source locations. Investigating local adaptation in relation to both geographic and environmental distance across key life history transitions may provide insight into the limitations of local adaptation and potential evolutionary consequences under climate change. <br/>"
