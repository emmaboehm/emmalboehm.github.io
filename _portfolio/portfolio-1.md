excerpt: "Populations may exhibit local adaptation due to a suite of abiotic and biotic selection pressures. However, climate change may disrupt these patterns of local adaptation by shifting environmental conditions away from historical norms. If so, then populations might not necessarily have highest fitness in environments closely matching the current environmental conditions of their source locations. Investigating local adaptation in relation to both geographic and environmental distance across key life history transitions may provide insight into the limitations of local adaptation and potential evolutionary consequences under climate change. <br/>"
